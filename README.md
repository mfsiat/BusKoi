# BusKoi 

## What is it? 
Bus koi is an application which shows it's users public transportation location and the available seats in it via a **IOT** device that is installed on the bus. By seeing the bus location and the availabale seats on it the user can decide which bus the user should get in and whether the user should wait for the bus or not. This application can save the users time by reaching the bus-stop on the right time and by not waiting for the bus for long time. 

People will know from their home whether the bus is available or not. By seeing the location of the bus the user could easily get to the bus stop at the right time.
